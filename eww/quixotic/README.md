# Eww Bar


### Tips For Getting Eww Widgets to Work:
1. The widgets were designed to work with bspwm workspaces. Make sure to define the workspace numbers within `scripts/workspace-primary` to reflect what is configured in `bspwmrc`.

2. Many of the scripts require specific paths which likely differ from system-to-system so test and inspect each script to determine where changes need to be made.

3. Colors are imported into `eww.scss` and the colors of images are changed after running the update_colors script. This script assumes you are using one of my Triangle wallpapers (`Wallpaper/Triangle'). Keep the name formatting the same or edit the script for the colors you want. 

4. Add your weather Key/ID from [Open Weather Map](openweathermap.org/) to `scripts/weather`.
